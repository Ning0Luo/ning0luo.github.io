<p style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 12px; margin-top:2px;"> My name is Ning Luo. As a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Yale University, I currently work on combining cryptography and formal methods, and develop protocols for privacy-preserving formal methods.
Formal methods are developed to provide mathematical procedures so that people can express and verify a variety of facts on systems. This gives people the impression that it is fine to expose the software to be analyzed,as well as these specifications, under which privacy is not much concerned. However, it is not true in some case. Consider the following setting of software distribution: modern software distribution often occurs within a walled garden, with an authority who must inspect and approve all new software releases. Software developers may hesitate to expose their programs because of several concerns. For example, the authority can be also potential competitors to them and has advantage of resource. On the other hand, the specification can be confidential as it reveals what people are looking for. Furthermore, with the development of techniques of specifications, the richer expressiveness will allow people specify more properties they personally care about, which in turn makes the specification become more private information than before. While a suite of techniques have been developed for formally verifying the properties of a given system, there is a lack of privacy-preserving formal methods that cryptography can be used to fill this. Inspired by this, the goal of my work is focused on designing protocols that facilitate the use of formal methods techniques in a privacy-preserving manner. </p>
